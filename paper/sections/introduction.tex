The history of Chinese printing spans more than twelve centuries.
Woodblock printing appeared in the 8th century: entire pages were carved in reverse on wood planks, inked, and pressed onto paper.
Movable-type printing, invented by Bi Sheng around~1040, allowed individual characters to be cast in ceramic, wood, or metal and assembled into pages.
Both technologies coexisted for more than a thousand years, each producing distinct patterns of character variation.
In every case, craftsmen imitated character models painted by a calligrapher.

\emph{Reverse typography} addresses the inverse problem: given a historical printed book, reconstruct faithful vectorised versions of the character models used to produce it.
The goal is to automatically generate a \emph{character glossary}---an inventory of all distinct character forms, each represented as a clean vector outline respecting the original calligraphy.
Such a glossary enables digital preservation, palaeographic study of printing workshops, font reconstruction, and cross-document comparison of printing traditions.

Modern OCR systems adapt poorly to historical prints due to degraded ink, irregular spacing, archaic character variants, and the absence of labelled training data.
A fully unsupervised approach is therefore required.
Our pipeline combines three key techniques:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{CRAFT}~\cite{baek2019character}, a learned text detector providing reliable character-level extraction without fine-tuning;
    \item \textbf{Affine scale-space vectorisation}~\cite{alvarez1993axioms,ciomaga2017curvature}, an affine-invariant geometric PDE that smooths character boundaries into clean vector outlines;
    \item \textbf{A contrario matching}~\cite{desolneux2000meaningful}, a statistical framework providing a principled, adaptive test for whether two character images depict the same glyph.
\end{enumerate}
Characters deemed similar are connected in a graph partitioned by the Leiden community detection algorithm~\cite{traag2019louvain}, and a two-stage refinement pipeline fusing visual registration and linguistic signals produces the final clusters from which the glossary is assembled.

We demonstrate the method on the \emph{Ying huan zhi lue} (Brief Records of the World, 1848), a Chinese book printed from individually carved woodblocks in which every character occurrence was uniquely engraved---a maximally challenging scenario for clustering.
The pipeline processes \nPages{} page images into approximately \nPatches{} character patches and produces a glossary of \nGlossaryEntries{} distinct character forms.
