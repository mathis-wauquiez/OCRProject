\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a fully unsupervised pipeline for \emph{reverse typography}: the automatic reconstruction of a vectorised character glossary from historical printed books, respecting the original calligraphy.
The method combines CRAFT text detection, affine scale-space vectorisation, \textit{a contrario} statistical matching, Leiden community detection optimising the CPM objective, and a two-stage refinement pipeline.
Demonstrated on the \emph{Ying huan zhi lue}, an 1848 Chinese book in which every character was uniquely carved from woodblocks, the pipeline processes \nPages{} pages into \nPatches{} character patches and produces a glossary of \nGlossaryEntries{} distinct character forms with an ARI of \ARIFinal{} on consensus labels.

% TODO: Discuss limitations and future directions (cross-corpus generalisation,
% deformation-invariant features, alternative refinement strategies).
